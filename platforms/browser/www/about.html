                            GoStore is a new kind of store with no checkout required. We created the world’s most
                            advanced shopping technology so you never have to wait in line. With our Just Walk Out
                            Shopping experience, simply use the GoStore app to enter the store, take the products you
                            want, and go! No lines, no checkout. (No, seriously.)
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="about-text-bottom">
                        <h2>How do I shop at GoStore?</h2>
                        <p>
                            All you need is a GoStore account, the free GoStore app, and a recent-generation iPhone or
                            Android phone. You can find the GoStore app on the Apple App Store, Google Play, and
                            GoStore Appstore.

                            When you arrive, use the app to enter the store, then feel free to put your phone away—you
                            don’t need it to shop. Then just browse and shop like you would at any other store. Once
                            you’re done shopping, you’re on your way. No lines, no checkout.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How does GoStore work?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies
                            used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. Our Just Walk
                            Out Technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves
                            and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the
                            store. A little later, we’ll send you a receipt and charge your GoStore account.

                        <p>
                            Yes. Our great team of associates works in both the kitchen and the store to prep
                            ingredients, make our ready-to-eat food, stock shelves, and help customers. (Need a product
                            recommendation? Ask an associate!)
